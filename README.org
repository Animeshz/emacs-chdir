* emacs-chdir

Syncs =/proc/self/cwd= of emacs process with changes to =(default-directory)=.

Package doesn't needs any trigger, as soon as included will start working immediately.

*** Installation

Installation using elpaca:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(use-package chdir
  :elpaca (chdir :host github :repo "Animeshz/emacs-chdir"
                :files (:default "chdir.el" "chdir-core.so")
                :pre-build ("make" "all")))
#+END_SRC

Alternatively, you can use [[https://github.com/Animeshz/linux-desktop/tree/nix/packages/emacs-chdir][my nix derivation]] and install it with home-manager.

Or build nix-derivation directly:
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
nix build 'github:Animeshz/linux-desktop#emacs-chdir'
#+END_SRC

*** Motivation

I use [[https://github.com/Animeshz/scripts/blob/main/main/pwd-launch][pwd-launch]] script to wrap launch of various applications. That allows them to open where the active/focused X window is currently.

Emacs was not updating its =/proc/self/cwd= which led my applications to launch where emacs was first launched, not where it currently is. This package provides [[https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/chdir.2.html][chdir()]] syscall to sync the =/proc/self/cwd= with changes to =(default-directory= elisp variable.
